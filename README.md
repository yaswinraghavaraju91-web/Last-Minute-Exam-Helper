# Last-Minute Exam Helper

## Problem Statement
College students often face extreme pressure during exams when they have very limited time to prepare. Most students are confused about what topics to study first, what can be skipped, and how to effectively use the remaining hours before an exam.

Existing AI tools and learning platforms provide generic explanations and lengthy content, which are not suitable for last-minute exam preparation. These tools do not consider time constraints, exam-oriented priorities, or marks-focused strategies.

## Proposed Solution
Last-Minute Exam Helper is a web-based, AI-assisted system designed specifically for time-pressured exam preparation. The system generates a personalized, exam-focused study plan based on the remaining preparation time, exam mode, and syllabus topics.

Unlike generic AI chatbots, this solution focuses on prioritization, revision efficiency, and expected exam questions to help students maximize their marks within limited time.

## Unique Features
- **Time-Pressure Mode:** Adapts output based on hours left for the exam (2, 6, or 24 hours).
- **Marks-Oriented Learning:** Pass Mode for minimum preparation and Score Mode for high-weightage topics.
- **Expected Question Generator:** Suggests likely exam questions based on selected topics.
- **Stress-Aware Exam Tips:** Provides quick last-minute revision tips to reduce anxiety.

## System Workflow
1. Student enters subject name, syllabus topics, hours left, and exam mode.
2. System processes the input using predefined logic and AI assistance.
3. Output includes topic priority, revision plan, expected questions, and exam tips.

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- AI Support: OpenAI API / Rule-based logic
- Version Control: GitHub

## Feasibility & Scalability
The system can be extended to support multiple subjects, different exam patterns, and college-specific question trends. It can evolve into a complete exam preparation SaaS platform.

## Impact
- Helps students focus on important topics
- Reduces exam stress
- Improves time utilization
- Enhances exam performance
